ConfigTree contains a dictionary of nodes, indexed by filepath
Config is a dictionary of config section dictionaries by name

expression types:
key1 = ${filepath@section:key}

the divider to use for outputing vector keys is dependant on the output module for the final section
filepath also takes a pure path and will try to infer __env__.yml __pkg__.yml and __root__.yml filename if they exist.

- search the KRO for the closest available populated key
- if it's a raw value, clean it up
- if it contains an expression into a different key, fetch that key recursively and sub it in
